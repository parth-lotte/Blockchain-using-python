<h1>Blockchain Using Python</h1>

<p>Hola! This repo is all about how I am working on creating a Blockchain as we all know that nowadays blockchain is often used like in Crypto , Healthcare etc as blockchain is an immutable ledger thus it's a secure way of keeping the records as it is decentralized and thus with  distributed P2P network it is not easy to modify or tamper the blockchain as each block stores its own hash and hash of the previous block also. 
  <br>
  <br>
  There are various Hashing algo used in blockchain some of them are:</p>
  <ol type="i">
  <li><b>SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512</b></li>
  <p>Each algorithm is represented by the length of its output. SHA-2 algorithms are more secure than SHA-1 algorithms, but SHA-2 has not gained widespread use.</p>
  <li><b>LANMAN</b></li>
  <p>Microsoft LANMAN is the Microsoft LAN Manager hashing algorithm. LANMAN was used by legacy Windows systems to store passwords.</p>
  <li><b>SHA-1</b></li><p> This is the second version of the Secure Hash Algorithm standard, SHA-0 being the first. SHA-1 creates 160-bit outputs. SHA-1 is one of the main algorithms that began to replace MD5, after vulnerabilities were found. </p>
</ol>
<h2>Tools used:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <b>SPYDER</b>
    <p>Spyder the Scientific Python Development Environment, it is a free integrated development environment (IDE) that is included with Anaconda.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
     <b>POSTMAN</b>
    <p> Postman is an API development tool which helps to build, test and modify APIs. It has the ability to make various types of HTTP requests(GET, POST, PUT, PATCH), saving environments for later use, converting the API to code for various languages(like JavaScript, Python).</p>
  </li>
</ol>
